## Scraping, Processing and Investigating Amazon Review Data

This project scrapes reviews from Amazon, processes and analyses the text, and uses it to train a sentiment analysis model. 

The review data comes from a range of different types of products sold on Amazon across a range of ratings. 

This work could be repeated using a larger dataset to create a more accurate sentiment analysis model which can be applied to non-rated reviews/comments.
